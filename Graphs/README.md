# Graph and the DFS and BFS Algorithms

**A few Notes:**

* BFS is done iteratively
* DFS is done recursively
* This program uses a custom queue class


the test driver is inside main.cpp

## How to compile and test
the files "graph.cpp" and "main.cpp" have to be compiled together, otherwise the code will not run. Use any capable C++ compiler
