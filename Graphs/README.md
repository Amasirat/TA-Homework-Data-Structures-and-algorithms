# Graph and the DFS and BFS Algorithms

**A few Notes:**

* BFS is done iteratively
* DFS is done recursively
* This program uses a custom queue class


the test driver is inside main.cpp

## How to compile and test
the files "graph.cpp" and "main.cpp" have to be compiled together, otherwise the code will not run.
you can use this command if you are on Linux

```
$ clang++ main.cpp graph.cpp -o main
# or for gcc
$ g++ main.cpp graph.cpp -o main
```
